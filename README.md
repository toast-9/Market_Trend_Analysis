# Analysis of Stocks using 
## 1) Bollinger Bands
Bollinger Bands:

Bollinger Bands consist of three lines: the middle band (typically a Simple Moving Average, SMA), and two outer bands that are standard deviations away from the middle band.
The middle band represents the trend or the average price over a specified period, often 20 days.
The upper band is calculated by adding two times the standard deviation of the price to the middle band.
The lower band is calculated by subtracting two times the standard deviation from the middle band.
Bollinger Bands are used to identify volatility and potential reversal points. When the price moves to the upper or lower band, it is considered overextended and may revert toward the middle band, which can be a signal for traders.

## 2) Relative Strength Index 
Relative Strength Index (RSI):

RSI is an oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements. It ranges from 0 to 100 and is typically displayed as a line chart.
RSI is calculated using the average gains and losses over a specified period (commonly 14 days).
When RSI is above 70, it is considered overbought, suggesting the asset may be due for a downward correction.
When RSI is below 30, it is considered oversold, indicating the asset may be due for an upward correction.
Traders use RSI to identify potential reversal points and to gauge the strength of a trend.

## 3) Simple Moving Average 
Simple Moving Average (SMA):

A Simple Moving Average is a basic form of a moving average and is calculated by taking the average price of an asset over a specified period (e.g., 20 days).
The SMA smooths out price data, creating a trend-following indicator.
It provides a clear representation of an asset's historical price performance and is used to identify trends and potential support/resistance levels.
A common strategy is to compare the SMA with the current price to determine whether an asset is in an uptrend or downtrend.

## 4) Moving Average Convergence Divergence
Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD):

MACD is a trend-following momentum indicator that shows the relationship between two exponential moving averages (EMAs) of the asset's price.
The MACD line is calculated by subtracting the 26-day EMA from the 12-day EMA.
The signal line is a 9-day EMA of the MACD line.
The MACD histogram represents the difference between the MACD line and the signal line.
MACD helps traders identify changes in the strength, direction, momentum, and duration of a trend. It can signal potential buy and sell opportunities.
